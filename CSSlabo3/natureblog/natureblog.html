        OSCA/TMEM63 channels are the largest known family of mechanosensitive channels
        playing critical roles in plant and mammalian mechanotransduction.
        Here we determined 44 cryogenic electron microscopy structures of OSCA/TMEM63 channels
        in different environments to investigate the molecular basis of OSCA/TMEM63 channel
        mechanosensitivity. In nanodiscs, we mimicked increased membrane tension and observed a
        dilated pore with membrane access in one of the OSCA1.2 subunits. In liposomes,
        we captured the fully open structure of OSCA1.2 in the inside-in orientation,
        in which the pore shows a large lateral opening to the membrane.

    The dual jaw joint of Morganucodon consists of the dentary–squamosal joint
    laterally and the articular–quadrate one medially. The articular–quadrate joint
    and its associated post-dentary bones constitute the precursor of the mammalian
    middle ear. Fossils documenting the transition from such a precursor to the mammalian
    middle ear are poor, resulting in inconsistent interpretations of this hallmark
    apparatus in the earliest stage of mammaliaform evolution. Here we report
    mandibular middle ears from two Jurassic mammaliaforms: a new morganucodontan-like
    species and a pseudotribosphenic shuotheriid species6.

        Phase-change memory (PCM) has been considered a promising candidate for solving
        von Neumann bottlenecks owing to its low latency, non-volatile memory property
        and high integration density. However, PCMs usually require a large current
        for the reset process by melting the phase-change material into an amorphous phase,
        which deteriorates the energy efficiency. Various studies have been conducted
        to reduce the operation current by minimizing the device dimensions, but this
        increases the fabrication cost while the reduction of the reset current is limited.
        Here we show a device for reducing the reset current of a PCM by forming a
        phase-changeable SiTex nano-filament.

        Vertebrate organs require locally adapted blood vessels1,2. The gain of such
        organotypic vessel specializations is often deemed to be molecularly unrelated
        to the process of organ vascularization. Here, opposing this model, we reveal
        a molecular mechanism for brain-specific angiogenesis that operates under the
        control of Wnt7a/b ligands—well-known blood–brain barrier maturation signals.
        The control mechanism relies on Wnt7a/b-dependent expression of Mmp25, which
        we find is enriched in brain endothelial cells. CRISPR–Cas9 mutagenesis in
        zebrafish reveals that this poorly characterized glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored
        matrix metalloproteinase is selectively required in endothelial tip cells to enable
        their initial migration across the pial basement membrane lining the brain surface.
